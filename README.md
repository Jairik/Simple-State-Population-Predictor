# Basic State Population Predictor
 Elementary learning exercise for python web scraping, visualization, and ML. This program will

 - Pull state population data off of https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html and clean it
 - Prompt the user to select a state to predict
 - Run a linear regression model to predict the future state population
 - Visualize past populations and the new predicted population using a bar chart

 This served as my first attempt with many of the libraries, so code is likely unoptimized/bad.
